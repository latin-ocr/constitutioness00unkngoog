shall determine whether a provincial meeting shall be held for
the election of these two, or whether the Provincial without a
meeting shall choose them, as he shall deem expedient in the
Lord. Το these three the whole Province shall entrust its in·
terest, and whatever shall be settled by the general assembly
in which they attend, shall be established. If besides these two
delegates, the Genera] shall appoint certain others, or the Pro-
vincial resolve to bring them, their right shall be the same as
the rest. But if beyond the three, the Provincial should select
more; he shall not add more than two, so that, in all, five may
come from one Province.

2 Of the Professed who shall attend in the Assembly, each shall
have a single vote, the General alone shall have two. But if
the numbers are equal, the Provincials shall be preferred to the
rest, and if among the Provincials there is an equality, that
part to which the General, or, in case of his death, his Vicar
shall incline, shall have the preference. For as the help of the
divine Gracc is more necessary to them by reason of the office
they bear, it is to be hoped that God and our Lord will more
largely bestow it on thern, that so they may think and speak
