THE GONSTITUTIONS ΟΠ

convoke a Congregation; namely, the Provincials with two
others whom each shall bring with him from his Province, who
shall be bound to assemble. Andif the matter is divulged, and
generally known, without waiting for the summons of the four
AssistantS, the Provincials ought to assemble summoning one

another: and the very first day in which they shall enter the
place of assembly, where the four who convoked them shall be

was so): and it shall be so arranged, if it seems good to more

assistance the General enjoyed, the Society should provide
others, so that he being better aided and assisted thereby,
nothing essential to the government of the Society may be
