CHAP. Vlllr

l Loornvo to the object to which the studies of our Society are
directed, it will contributa to that end, that they begin to
habituate themselves to wield their spiritual weapons for the
benefit of their neighbours. For although this should be done
in our Houses more properly and continuously, it should yet be
commenced in our Colleges. ,

ssirst of all, those who in the judgment of the Superior are to
be admitted to sacred orders, should be instructed in the method
of sayinglllassrso that besides intelligence and internal devo-
tion, they may exhibit a bccoming externa] manner to the
edification of the hearers: and that all the Society, as far as
possible, may use the same ceremonies: in which so far as the
variety of countn'es shall allow, it shall follow the Roman prac-
tice as being more general, and that which the Apostolic See has
adopted in a more peculiar manner.

3 Let them accustom themselves also in setting forth their sermons
and sacred lecturas to the way best adapted for the edification of
the people, which differs from the Scholastio method; and to
discharge this duty let them labour to acquire the vernacular
tangue of the country thoroughly. There are other things
which they should have studied‚ and have at their fingers’ ends,
which will be useful to this duty; and in short, they should
maulay all means which may assist them to discharge this office
the better, and with greater spiritual profit to others.

thet them be accustomed also to the ministration of the Sacra-
menta of Confession and Communion, and endeavour to compre-
hend and discharge that duty not only as relatas to themselves
but also to the penitents and communicante, that they may
understand and receive the same duly and usefully to the glory
of God.

blas them accustom ¹themselves to communicate their spiritual ,
exercises to others-when each has experienced them in himself;
and let all be diligent not only to give an explanation of them,
but also to acquire a readiness in wielding this kind of spiritual
arms which by the grace of God is felt to contributa so largely

lo His‘service.
