7 Among the officers necessary for the Rector, in the first place,

a proper person must be selected to be Sub-rector, or Major
Domo, and to see to all things which appertain to the general
good. There should be a Syndic also to superintend external
concems; one to see to spiritual affairs, and two or more
besides, in whose prohity and prudence the Rector has great
reliance; and with whom he may consult on the more difficolt
occasions, and such as seem to involve the greater glory of God.
Others also are needful for particular duties.

8 Let the Rector see that the Collegians pay to every man in the
discharge of his duty an entire obedience, that the other officers

obey the Sub-rector, and himself also, justas he commands

them. ¹
lt may be well to state this in general, that those who have to
exact obedience from others should set them an example of that
obedience which they should pay to their Superiora in tle place
of Christ.

athe maintenance of regularity as to time in studies, prayers,
messes, lectures, food, sleep, and other things will be useful in
all respects; and a signal should he given at stated hours; at
the sound of which, let all forthwith bctake themselves to that
whereto they are summoned, not stopping to complete even a
single letter. It will however pertain to the Rector, or to him
who superintends, to see when these hours are to be changed
according to the seasons or other sufficient causes 3 and let what
he determines be observed.

10 The Rector should himself read or teach the Catechism forty
days. Let him see also which of the Collegians, especially
towards the conclusion of their studies, and to what extent at
home and abroad, should impart instruction to others in con-
'ferences in setting spiritual exercises, iu hearing confessione, in
sermons, lectures, or explanatione of the Catechism, partly for
their own improvement, partly for the benefit of others as well
within as without; and all things duly considered, let him pro-
vide for whatever he shall perceive most pleasing to the divine
and supreme Goodness, and His greater service and glory.
