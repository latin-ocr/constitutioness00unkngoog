give occasion or countenance to that irregular intemperate zeal
which threatens to dash in pieces like a potter's vessel the very
frame and fabric of the Chureh. If we would preserve what is
left us of our Protestant iustitutionS, we must he careful above
all things to have anion among ourselves.

THE END.
