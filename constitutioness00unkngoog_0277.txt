ecclesiastics, whose morals and learning were equally tried, would
be to the Catholic religion, thought fit to second the wish of so
great and beneficent a Prince.

In consequence, by our Bn'ef, dated 7th March, 1801, we granted
to the said Francis Kareu, and his colleagues residing in Russia‚ or
who should repair thither from other countries, power to form
themselves into a body or congregation of the Company of Jesus;
they are at liberty to unite in one or more houses to be pointed
out by their superior, provided these houses are situated within
the Russian empire. We named the said Francis Kareu General of
the said congregation: we authorized them to resume and follow
the rule of St. Ignatius of Loyola, approved and confirmed by the
constitutions of Paul ΙΙΙ. our predecessor, of happy memory,in

favour to the kingdom of Sicily, on the warm request of our dear
son in J esus Christ, King Ferdinand,¹ who begged that the Com-
pany of Jesus might be re-established in his dominions aud states
as it was in Russia‚ from a conviction that in these deplorable
times, the Jesuits were instructors most capable of forming youth
to Christian piety aud the fear of God, which is the beginning of
wisdom and to instruct them in seience and letters. The duty of
our pastoral charge leading us to second the pious wishes of these
