He does not sin who follows a probahle opi· ’
nion, rejecting tle more prohable, whether the
latter he the opinion of others, or of the agent
himself, . oud whether the less probable opinion

which he follows be the safer or the less case.—
(Lib. w. Disp 12 γι. 1.)

(A confossor) may lswfully follow the probable „

opinion of his penitent, and reject his own -

(Ittd. hisp. 13. esc.)
And this is true, although the probahle opinion
which the penitent follows should be injurious

liceret sequiprohabiliorem minus tutem.''—Ibid. γι. 1‘285. ·
