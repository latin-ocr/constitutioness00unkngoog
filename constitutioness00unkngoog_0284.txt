aud resolute attachment to the cause os the Society, were so mrny
proofs of the wisdom of those who selected him to fill these
situations, where his zeal and his talents might be directed to the
best account. He had, it appears, from his own evidence, taken
the simple vows of the Order during his residence in England;
but doubts have erisen whether he could be lawfully aggregated in a
country where a restoration of the Society by the Pope had not
taken place, he was compelled to seek elsewhere an opportunity of

the proprietor of Clongowes Wood, in the county of Kildare‚ and
six miles from Maynooth, for the surrender of that estate as the -
