' advanced until he be diligently and publiely examined by persons
appointed, who shall carefully perform this duty, and he shall be
found quahfied 101 that Science, whether 110 belong 10 the
Society, or n0t; Secondly, That the door may be closed against
Ambition, no fixed places shall be assigned to those who are
raised 10 Degrees ; but let them rather study in honour to
prefer one another, without observing any difference of places:
Thirdly, As the Soeiety instructa gratuitously, so let it raiae to
degrees grattutously; and to those without the Society, let very
little expense, although volunta1y,be permitted, lest custom at
length obtain the 10100 01 law; and in this point in the course
01 time they exceed moderation. Let the Rector take care also

110110 permit the Mastera or any others 01 the Society to 10-
ceive, 101 themselves or the college, money, 01 any gift from any
one 101 anything done 101 his service; since 110 Lord 011101
