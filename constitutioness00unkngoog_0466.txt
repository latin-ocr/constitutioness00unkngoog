0001001100. Laymann, Jes. “

This' is the opinion of sotus (and many others),
and of John Lacroix. Whence it is evident, that
he . thinks with his associates, thata declared
belief 10 the mysteries of the lucarnation and
Trinity is not a necessary mean of salvation
And indeed justly: for otherwise, as Serra has
well observed with Laymaun, salvation would be
impossible to those who were born deal, when
once they were corrupted bymortal sin; since the
mysteries ,01 the lucarnation *and Trinity could
not be explicitlypropounded to theml'⁰
