To this effect we implore without ceasing the protection and the aid
of God, that he would inspiro us and all his ilock with counsels of
peace, and open to us the road which leads to it. We know,
besides, tuat we ure established by tde Diviae Provideare over kiap-
doms und rationein order to placit up, destroy, disperse, dissipate,
pluat or noumsi, as may best conduce to the right cultivation of

their instituti0n; ii at any time they seemed disposed rather to
trouble than maintain the public tranquillity; the same Apostolic
See, which had availed itseli of its own authority to establish these
orders, did not hesitate to reform them by new laws, to recall them
