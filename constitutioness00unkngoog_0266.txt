We have seen, in the grief of our beart, that neither these
remedies, nor an infinity of others, since employed, bave produced
their due effect, or silenced the accusations and complaints against

the said society. Our other predecessors, Urban Vll. Clement
IX. X. XI. and XII. Alexander VII. and VIII. Innocent X.

XII. and XIII. and Benedict XIV. employed without effect all

their efforts to the same purpose. ln vain did they endeavour, by
salutary constitutions, to restore peace to tbe Church; as well with
respect to secular affairs, with which the company ought not to
have interfered, as with regard to the missions; which gave rise to
great disputes and oppositione on the part of the company with the
ordinaries, with other religious orders, about the holy places, and
communities of all sorts in Europe, Africa, and America, to the
great loss of souis, and great scandal of the people; as likewise
concerning the meaning and practice of certain idolntrons cerernonr'es
adopted in certain places, in contempt of those justly approved by
the Catholic Church; and further, concerning the use and explica-
tion of certain metiens, which the Holy See has, with reason, pro-
antbert narrandumne, ond manifestly contrary to 'qood morale, and,
lastly, concerning other matters of great importance and prime
necessity towards preserving the integrity and purity of tbe
doctrines of the gospel, from which maxims have resulted very
great inconveniencies and great detriment, botb in our days and in
past ages; such as tte revolts ond intestine troubles in some of tlte
Catholic states, persecutions against the Churcb in some countries of
Asia and Europe, not to mention the vexation aud grating solicitude
which these melancholy affairs brought on our predecessors, princi-
pally upon Innocent XI. of blessed memory, who found himself
reduced to the necessity of forbiddinp tlte company to receive any
more novices; and afterwards upon Innocent XIII . who was obliged
to threaten the company with the same punishment; and, lastly,
upon Benedict XlV. who took the resolution of ordaining a general
visitation of all the bouses and colleges of the company in tbe
kingdom of our dearly beloved son in J esus Christ, the most faithful
King of Portugal.

The late apostolic letter of Clement XIII. of blessed memory,
our immediate predecessor, by which the institute of the Company
of Jesus was again approved and recommended, was fnr frona
