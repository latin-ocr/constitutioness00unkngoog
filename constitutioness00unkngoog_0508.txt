· ’ An useful doubt arises in the case of ‘a son who
transacta at a distance his father's business, or
always remains' with him in the house to sell
the goods of his father who is a merchant,
¹whether he may take secretly as much of his
father's property in return for his labour and
industry, as his father would have given to a
hired servant for the same labour and occupation3
and that, to'o, in addition to' his father’s ex-
pense in ¹maintaining him? The reply must be
made in the affimativa-(Tam. 11. Lib. vii. c. 3.
w. 11'.)‘ ·
Servants are also bound ¹to restore to their
master whatever they have taken beyond* their
Α weges aad ‘proper' food, provided that their
masters have not compelled them to fulfil duties
'over ahd above those for which they agreed‚· sor
toea they moyseto something more (provided it
be just) for the duty and service which they are

compelled to discharge beyond their agreement.-
(laid. c. 11. n. 4.)
