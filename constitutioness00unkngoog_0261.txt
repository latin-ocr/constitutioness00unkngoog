troubles arisen therein, he invested the ordinaries with full power
and authority over the members of the orders thus suppressed,
commanding them to take the dress of the seeular clergy, and
assigning them annmties out of the revenues of the suppressed
convents, granting witha] the permission to enter into such other
orders aa they should see fit.

The same Innocent X. having considered that no spiritual ad-
vantages could be derived from the regular congregation of the
priests of the good Jesus, did, by another brief of the aad of
June, 1651, abolish the same lor ever. He submitted the said
regolars to the jurisdiction of their Ordinary, assigned them a
convenient portion of the revenues of the congregation, permitting
them to enter into any other approved order, and reserving to
himself the disposition of the goods of the said congregation, to
be applied as he should see fit to works of piety.

Lastly, Clement IX. our predecessor, of blessed memory, having
considered that the three regular orders of the regular canons of
St. Gregory in Alga, of the Jeromites of Fiesole, and of the
Jesuits instituted by St. colombanus, were of no further use to the

contestations before the courts of justice, contenting themselves to
follow the laws of prudence, and relying wholly oa that plenitude os
power which they possessed in so emineat a deyree as vicars of Christ
upon earth, aad as swereiyn moderators of tlre Christian republic:
they executed all these changes without giving “the regular orders,
which they proposed to suppress, the faculty of producing any
arguments in their defence, or of clearing themselves from the
heavy accusations brought against them, or of opposing the power-
ful motivas by which the holy pontiffs were induced to take such
resolutions.
