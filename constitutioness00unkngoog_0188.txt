OF THE oovsaNMsrsr OF THE COLLEGES.

l Tus Professed Society shall have the supreme care or superin-
tendence of the Colleges according to the letters of the Apostolic
See. For since the Professed cannot apply any portion of those
revenues to their private advantage or their own use; it is most
consonant to reason that they will proceed with greater purity
and religion more constantly and perseveringly in those things
which are necessary to the good government of the Colleges to
the' greater service of God and our Lord.

(generally speaking) the eoecutioo of this superintendence stall
beloup to tle Generul, who keeping before his eyes the object
towards which the Colleges and the Society at large are directed,
shall hest perceive what is beneficia] for them.

3 The General himself therefore, or some one empowered hy him
for this duty, shall appoint one of the Coadjutors of the Society
to preside over each College; who shall give an account of the
duty assigned to him to the Provincial, or whomsoever the
General shall nominate. And the General also may remove the
Rector, and relieve him from his responsibility, as shall appear
to him most desirahle in the Lord.

lcare should be taken that he who undertakes the office of
Rector should be most exemplary, of great edification, and strict
mortification in all depraved inclinations, and tried especially in
Obedience, and in humility; one endowed with discretiori, sldlled
in government, versed in business, and experienced in spiritual
concerns; knowing how to interchange severity with mildness
indue time and place, anxious, laborious, leamed; in short one
in whom the Superiors may confide, and to whom they may
solely communicate their power; since, the ampler this autho·
rity, the more effectually the Colleges will be directed to the
greater glory ol God.
