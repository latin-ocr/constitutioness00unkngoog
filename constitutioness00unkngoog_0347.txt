The Constitutions are also very provident in r

relieving this class ol Jesuits from all arrxiety

respecting their property. lt is to be resigned
to the General before they are permitted to take

the vows, in the expectation that it will be dis- ι

tributed to the poor, and in the certainty that
it will be withheld from themselves end their
relations.⁴ Before they have actually entered
the society, they are permitted to dispose ol their
property according to their will-for this ,very
excellent reason, that the sager fraternity have
not the power to control them. But when once
they are fairly taken in, they must not think to
interfere in the disposal of their riches, whether

they are in present possession, or in expectanoe

only. Whether their property be secular or ¹

ecclesiasticah they must resign it with a cheer·
fulness becoming the followers of a spiritual life.
And if any scruples should arise out ol affection
for their poor relations, the disposing verdiet of
two or three pious J esuits will provide immediate
relies for their troubled consciences.⁶
