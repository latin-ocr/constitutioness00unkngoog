minished the satisfaction with which the institution was regarded
by such of the titrdar hierarchy as held what are termed ultra-
montana sentimenta. The heads of the Roman Catholic Church
in lreland had generally sided with the J esuits. They are believed

- to have unanimously accepted the Bull Unigenitum and to have

acquiesced in other edicts which had a like tendency to exalt the
papal power. They appear, therefore, to have viewed with dis-
pleasure and alarin the disposition towards Jansenism manifested at
· Maynooth, and even threatening to obtain there a positive ascen-
dancy. As au instance of its prevalence may be mentioned that
Dr. Ferris, one of the Professors, aman of learning, and highly
esteemed among the pupils? had in lecturing his class ventured so
near the borders of heresy as to affirm that “the merits of the
sainte, compared with the merits of Christ, were uo more than a
drop of water compared with the ocean.'’ It was thence obvious
that measures could not be too speedily taken to meet this pressing,
danger, and to restore the tenets of Jesuitism to their proper
ascendancy. For the accomplishment of this object recourse was
had to the establishment of Stonyhurst3 on the perfect orthodoxy
of which nota shade of suspicion had ever been cast, and which
was now in circumstances to afford very important aid. The Rev.
Peter Kenny, who had been educated partly at Stonyhurst, and
afterwards in the Collega of Palermo, was translated from the
former residence to Maynooth, where he filled the office of Vice-
President: that of President being at the same time held by Dr.
Murray, the present titular Arohbishop of Dublin. In addition to
the proper duties of his collegiata office, Mr. Kenny was also
entrusted with the occasional charge of conducting the “ Retreats,”
or those seasons at which the students are accustomed to retire for
the sake of meditation and discussion. Τίιθ subjects for consider-
ation at such times are fixed by the conductor, who also delivers
every day one or more hortatory discourses; and may, at the
conclusion of the Retreat, hear the confessions of such students as
apply to him. Mr. Kenny thus enjoyed most ample and favourahle
opportunities of inculcating the principles of his order, and of
eradicatiug any opinions of an opposite complexion which, through
his intimate acquaintance with the most secret sentimenta of the
students, he might discover the slightest tendency in any of them
to adopt. The testinronies which he had given of the most devoted
