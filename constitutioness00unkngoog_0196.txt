3 Every week also there shall be a declamation, (ss was said in
treating 01 the Colleges,) by one 01 the Students on subjects
teuding to the edification 01 the hearers, and inciting them 10
maressa iu all purity and virtue 3 that thus their style may not
only be exercised, but their morals improved. And all those
who understand Latin shall attend these declamations.

in the Schools, nor anything indecorous or dissolute in such

object. To keep this in mind, at the commencement 01 every

quite hopeless, whilst he seems to be iujurious to others, itis
better to remove him from the Schools, thau to retain him where
he does no good to himself, and only harm to others.
