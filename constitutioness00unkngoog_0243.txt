of them ought to recommend to God that part spccifieally en.
trusted to him by private prayer, aad remembrance in his sacri-
fices ; and consider what will be most beneficid within it in
securing that which the Society proposes to itself.

He should confer with the rest, whenever it seems essential to
do so; and they may referto the General what they have so
discussed. They shall attend to subjecta proposed by the
General or the Secretary of the Society: that when they are
thoroughly discussed they may be referred to the General.
And in a word they should assist and relieve the General by
weighing and arranging things relating as well to learning as to
practice which require very great consideration. Besides this,
and whatever else they can do in many things more usefully,
they may find leisure for preaching, lecturing‚ hearing confes-
sione, and other good and pious works to the glory of God and
the assistance of souls.

ll The number of these Assistants at present shall be four; and
they may be the same as those mentioned before, page 89.
And although highly important matters are to be handled by
them, still the power of determining shall remain with the
General after he has heard them.

12 In the third kind of assistance, namely, diligence to accomplish
and fulfil whatever is resolved upon for the necessary interests
of the Society; such as to expedite all manner of business per-
taining to the Houses or Colleges and also to protect their
property; and generally to transact all affairs, the aid of one
Proctor general will be very useful, aad is indeed essentia13 he
shall reside in Rome, and shall be rich in prudence, fidelity and
dexterity in dealing with mankind, and in all other good quali-
ties; but he shall nothe Professed, nor live in any of the
Houses of the professed Society, but in some other (of which
mention 1s made in, the Fourth Part) and he shall be assisted by
his agents and officere necessary for those matters which he can-
not effect alone.

la Provided with assistance of this extent the General shall occupy
that time which his health and bodily strength permit, partly
with God, partly in business with his officials and ministers,
partly in solitary contemplation and in resolving what is to be
done with the aid and favour of God and our Lord.
