Madness has not in itself any moral, or
formal, or radical, or material, or objective oppo-
sition to the intellectual nature: therefore, there ¹
is no reason why it could not have existed in the
nature which was assumed by the Wesen-

Therefore, there is no reason for conceiving
it repugnant (to suppose) that the Wonn assumed
an insane nature, or to admit that madness was

in the nature which he had already assumed.⁸⁰ ’
