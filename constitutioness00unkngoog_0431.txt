11 a man whose mind is occupied with some
practical doubt, dwells upon it with delight, but
does not reflect that it is not lawful to delight
in it, while his will is entirely ¹abhorrent from
it, and he is resolved, as far as possible, oo refuse .
the delight if the sinfulness of it should ever
occur to him3 he is evidently comoed from nn, ’
although he should think upon it with deliget sor
¹a whole day.⁰⁰ The reason is, that as long Eas
the understanding does 'not reflect 'upon the
'wickedness of that which is' offered :to the will . s.
the consent <ff the⁴ will is ,not a sin, because the
sinfulness of it was not known3 unless the 'inad-
vertence should have arisen from gross negli-
gence‚ or* in a' depraved³ inclination ·t0 sin. ’
