society should undergo an apostolic visitation. Sixtns V. convineed
that these demands and solicitations of Philip were just aad well
smded, did, witlant hesitation, eomply tlereucitb; and in conse·
quence, named a bishop of distinguished prudence, virtue, and
learning, to be apostolica] visitor, and at the same time deputeda
mngregation of cardinale to examine this matter.

But this pontiff having been carried off hy a premature death,
this wise undertaking remained without effect. Gregory XIV.
being raised to the supreme apostolic chair, approved, in its utrnost
extem, the institution of the society, by his letter aab plumbo, dated
the nath of July, 1591. He confirmed all the privileges which

society? On the conhary, very violent disputes arose on all sides,
concerning the doctrine of the society, which many represented as
eonuary to the orthodox saith and to sonnd morals. The dissen-
sione among themselves and with others, grew every day more
animatam the accusatione against the society were multiplied
without number, and especially with regard to that iaautiuble castra
of temporal possessione with which it was reproached. Hence the
aiae, not only of those well-known troubles which brought so much
care and solicitude upon the Holy See, but also of the resolutioris
which certain sovereigns toolr against the said order.

It resulted, that instead of obtaining from Paul V. of blessed
memory, a fresh confirmation of its institute and privileges, the
