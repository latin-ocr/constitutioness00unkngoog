versed in Scholastic Divinity‚ and the Sacred Scriptures. And
although some in a shorter time are able to make no less
progress than others in a longer; neverthelesS, that some
common standard may be adopted, a distinct period of time
shall be presoeibed, and this shall be four entire years spent in
'lbeology after accomplishing their studies of the Liberal Arts
and Philosophy. For any one, therefore, to be admitted 10
Profcssion‚ it is needfnl that he should have exercised himself
during this time in that faculty, and that he be sufficiently
advanoed in it to the glory of God: and in proof of this
proficiency, let each man before bis Profession maintain positions
in Logic, Philosophy, and Scholastic Theology. Let four be
chosen 10 debete and determine, whether their learning be what
it ought, as they sincerely think, according to the truth. But
if they be not found qualificd with sufficient learning, it will bc
better to wait until they acquire it: 00 they also ought to wait,
who with regard to sslf-denial and the virtues becoming a
religious man have not obtained such a testimonial as is meet.

3 Others than these may be admitted to the profession of the
three solemn vows, although rarely, and not without peculiar
reasons of great weight ; and they too ought to have been
known in the Society at least seven years, and to have given in
it no small satisfaction of their talents and virtues to the glory

4 For any one to be admitted as a Coadjutor, it is necessary that
the Society be satisfied of his life and good example, and talents

in externa] matters, as the divine Goodness shall have com-
municated His gifts. The prudence of the Genera should
measure this, amless he has seen fit to entrust the duty to some
one in whom he has great confidence in the Lord.

5 Το 10 admitted to be approved Scholars, the same things in due
proportion are required, and that in a peculiar manner: so that
in the judgment of the General, or of the person to whom he
shall have confided the duty (trusting to the wisdom and probity
bestowed on him by God) it may be hoped from their talenta
and disposition that they will turn out learned men.
