3 Our neighbour is maisted also by holy aspiratione and prayers in
the sight of God ior the universal Church, and for those espe-
cially, who, spread abroad forits general welfare, are oi much
value3 for friends also, and benefactore, both living and departed
this life, whether they desire our prayers or not; for our enemies
ulso,if any there be3 and for those in whose service, they and
the rest of the Society in various places, amongst believers and
unbelievers, peculiarly employ themselves ; that God may
vonchsafe to dispose all men to receive His Gracc by the feeble
means of this humble Society.

tl'hey may assist also in the sacrifice of MasseS, and other holy
offices, without receiving alms for them ; whether others desire
to obtain them, or the individua] offers them to God in his own
devotion. And as to Messes, besides those which are said in
behalf of Founders, let one, two, or more, (according to the
number of priests, and generally as may be convenient) be said
every week for benefactore, living or dead, entreating God and
our Lord that He will vouchsafe to accept this holy sacrifice for
them, and that in His infinite and supreme bounty, the beneficence
which they have shown towards this our Society in godly love
and reverence may he returned to them in everlasting rewards.

tour neighbour is assisted also by the administration of the
Sacramenta, and especially by hearing confessione (to the dis-
charge of which duty some must be appointed by the Superior)
and in administering the sacrament of the holy Eucharist in the
Church, except at the feast of Easter.

6 het the word of God be diligently propounded to the people in
Church, in Sermone, Lectures and Catechising by such as the
Superior shall approve of and appoint to this duty, at such times
and in such a manner as shall seem expedient to him, to the
greater glory of God and the edification of souls.

7 'lhis may be done also out of the Church of the Society ; in
other Churches, in tle streete, or other plnres, when the Superior
shall deem it conducive to the greater glory of God.

8They shall study also to stimulate their neighbour by picus
discourse to amendment, by advice and exhortation to good
works, and by appointing spiritual exercises.

9 They shall devote themselves also to external works oi piety, so
iar as spiritual lahonrn, which are of greater moment, shall
allow, and their strength will admit of ; as in assisting the sick;
