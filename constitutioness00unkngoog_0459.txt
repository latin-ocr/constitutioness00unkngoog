brought, and required (to use his art), as Lessius,
Suarcz, and Sanchez teaeh. Yet the doctore

magician will consent, by express demand or
agreement, to use a legal rather than 'an illegal

which he has himself placed, and of everting their
moral effect3 which he is 10 justice bound todo,
andmay therefore be compelled to it even by

threats and urowa-(loia.)
