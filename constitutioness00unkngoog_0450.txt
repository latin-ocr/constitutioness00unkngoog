As the Wouo was able to assume a nature
’ which was irrational and incapable of all know·
ledge3 so might he also have tekene reasonable
nature, destitute of all knowledge-{Tora⁸ VI.
Disp.¹ 24. Seot. 4. a. 114.)

‘The Wono was able to assume the stupidity

of the ass's nature; and therefore, also, he might
have assumed the imperfectior of the human na·
ture.⁷⁸ ' ,
It is not more repugnant to (suppose) the
Wonn to err and to lie materially, through the
nature which he assumed, than in the same
assumed nature to suffer and to die: therefore, if
he was able to suffer and to die in his assumed
nature, he ‘could in the same nature heve erred
and have lied materially.⁷⁰
