delightful more pure, and more conducive to the edification of our
neighbour; and sinbe we know that our Lord Jesus Christ will
supply all things needful for food aad clothing to his servants
secking only the kingdom of God; all and singular shall vow
perpetual poverty, declaring that they cannot acquire either sepa-
rately or in common for the sustentation or use of the Society any
civil rights to any real property, or to its proceeds or incomes: but
shall be content to receive the use only of what is given them to
provide things needful. But they may bave in their Universities a
College or Colleges holding revenues‚ estates or possessione to be
applied to the wants and necessities of the students3 the govern-
. nent or superintendence of the said Colleges, and the said students,
astouching the election of Bactara, and students, their admission,
discharge, reception, exclusion, the appointment of statutas for the
iustmction, erudition, edification and correction of the studente, the
manner of supplying their food and clothing, and all other govern-
nent, regulation and care, being always secured to the General and
the Society; yet so, that the students shall not abuse the aforesaid
gouds, nor the Society convert them to their private use, but
minister to the necessity of the students. And these last also may
beadmitted into our Society when their progress in the spirit and
inlearning has been ascertained, and after sufficient probation.
All Associates whatsoever in holy orders, although they hold no
eclesiastica beneficas, nor incomes therefrom, shall, nevertheless,
bebound each-one privately, and separately, and not as a body to
say the service according to the ritual of the Church. These
tre the ,matters which with the allowance of our said Lord
Paul, and the Apostolie See, we can in some manner explain of
ourprofession: which we have now done, that by this writing we
may briefly inform not only those who question us touching our
manner of life, but our successors also, if by God’s favour we shall
have followers of this way, and since we have found many
aud great difficulties annexed to it, we have judged it right

to determine that no one be received into this Society, except he .

shall have been long and diligently tried: and when he shall be
found prudent in Christ, and conspicuous in learning, or in the purity
of the Christian life; then at length he may be admitted to the
warne of Jesus Christ, who will vouchsafe to favour these our Ι

humble beginnings to the glory of God the Father, to whom only
beprsise and honour for ever and ever : Amen.
