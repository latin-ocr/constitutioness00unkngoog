CHAP. ΙΙΙ

l Anrnoucrr they who live under the ohedience of the Society
ought not to obtrude themselves directly or indirectly into any
mission, whether sent by the Pope, or by their Superiorin the
name of Jesus Christ; yet he who rs dispatched to any exten-
sive region, (such as India or other Provinces) if no district is
assigned to him with express limitation, may remain in one
place or another, more or less, or move about as he shall think
most conducive to the glory of God weighing all circum-
stances, and using prayer, in perfect indifference as to his own
gratification. Hence it may easily be collected, ifthis is per-
mitted to individuale, when not repugnant ιο the great and chief
obedience to the Pope, that much larger power shall be given
to the Superior in missione of this lrind to order them to any
one place rather than another, as he shall deem expedient iu
the Lord.

2 Wheresoever any one remains, if he has no orders ιο use any
specified method, such as lecturas or sermons, he shall employ
himself in the way which the Society adopts, as stated in
the Sixth Part, and ιο be set forth iu the following chapter, as
he shall judge most convenient ; and on the other hand, he shall

avoid what is there ordered to be avoided, to the greater service
of God.

CHAP. IV.

l As the Society endeavours to aid their follow-creaturas, not only
by missions to various places, but also by constantly residing in
some (as in their Houses and Colleges): it is worth while to
observe ιγ what method souls may be assisted in such places3

so that every possible portion may be occupied ιο the glory of
God.

2 And in the first place, the honourable example of every Christian
virtue will conduce to the advantage of our neighbonr; so that
they endeavour to edify those amongst whom they dwell, not
less, nay, much more by their good deeds than by good words.
