As the power of punishing such persons with
temporal punishment, even with death, was
granted unta Peter for the correction and example
of others3 so must ie also be believed, that the
power of punishing with temporal penalties those
who are transgressore of the divine and human

sovereign pastor... It was said to Peter and to
his successors, “ Fced my sheep.” Now it is the
province of shepherds to punish their sheep with
that punishment with which just reason may
determine that they ought to be punished: if,
therefore, for the'general good of the ohurch,
prudence and right reason require that disobe-

temporal penalties and deprived of their king·
dom, the sovereign pastor of the chdrch may
impose those penalties upon them; for princes
are not without the fold of the ohurch.⁵⁴
