CHAP. VII.

WunN the Congregation is occupied, notin the election of a
General, but in other important concerus, pertaining to the
state of the Society; the confinement will not be necessary:
although care should be taken that the affairs to be treated of
be settled as soon as possible: but as that light by which it
