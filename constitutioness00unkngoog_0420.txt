· · (raa a. mr.) ·

Attianos-Some authors have said so. A
indeed, if the judge should think that theyv
hold the probable opinion which is opposed
his own, are more learned than himself, t
they are wise and good, and their reasons 1
bable, I ean hardly believe that he would

Antinum—I come now to the confessor..
the use of probable opinions he may Inops
abide by the more or less probable, provided r

Α that they be both truly probable.-(Ibid. a. 24
&memphim-I should wish to know wher

the confessor may adhere to the opinion of
penitent, which he believes himself to be
probable, although he may know that the s
opinion is commonly held by the doctors to
probable, and that therefore itis certainly
bablef-(Ibid. rt. 231.)

Aeriam-1 have no doubt but that the
fessor ought, in that case, to adhere to the
nion of the penitent, who certainly ought n(

’ be deprived of the right which belongs to i

¹ of choosing an opinion which is certainly
hable-(Ibtd. n. 232.)
