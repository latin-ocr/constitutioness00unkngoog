A better opinion cannot b'e formed of the
character of a body, especially such as that ol
the Jesuits, of which the government is monar-
chical, than by consulting the deorees of its rulers,
and the laws given by the general assemblies,
composed of the superiors and principal members
of the society.-( Vol. Il. Secorul Letter to Father
Scrry, p. 389.) ,

Congreg. V. Decret. 50. n. 2.

The constitutions ordain three things. The
first, that our members do not introduce new
opinions. The second, that if, at any time, they
should hold cn opinion contrary to that which
is commonly received, they shall adhere to the
decision of the society. The third, that in conÎ‡
troverted questions, in which either opinion is
far from being common, thoy restrict themselves
to conformity3 that thus we may all hold the
same doctrine and the same language, according
to the apostle.
