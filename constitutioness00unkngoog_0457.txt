please me; because, when the astrologer or
divinet has exerted all the diligence in the dia·
bolic art which is essential to his purpose, he has
fulfilled his duty, whatever may be the result.
As the physician, when he has made use of medi·
eines according to the principles of his professional
knowledge, is not bound tp restore the fee which
he has received if his patient should die; so
neither is the astrologer bound to restore his
charge and costs to the person who has consulted
him, except when he has used no effort, or was
ignorant of his diabolic art; because, when he
has used his endeavours, he has not deceived.-

If a magician can remove en enchentment by
lawful means, he may be required to do so; he
may be hribed with money, and compelled with
stripes to remove it: and that, too, even although
it should he foreseen that he would 'do it by a
new enchantment: for since he may do it byla
lawful method‚ I have a right to demand it of
him3 and it will be imputed to his own wiched-
ness if he should do it by unlowful means.—
