all who 11111111111111111111101111180011111 give themselves to the

study of the solid and perfect virtues, and of spiritual concerns,
and consider that more depende 011 these than on learning 01
other human and natural gifts. For these are the more internal
means, from which efficacy should be derived in the more
external towards the object proposed by us.

3 This foundation being laid, the Ι1111111111 means which procure the
instrumentality of God and our Lord in what regards our neigh-

y bours, will conduee entirely to the preservation and increase of

are committed to the care 01 the Society, and the metbod of
proceeding described in the Fourth Part is observed, it will con-
tribute to the same end.

5 And since Poverty is aethe strongest rampart to Religious Orders,
to maintain them in their due estate and discipline, and defend
them from numerous enemies (for which reason the Devil labours
to destroy it in various ways) it greatly concems the security and
extension of the whole body entirely to remove every appearance
of avarice; accepting no revennae, nor possessione, nor stipenda
