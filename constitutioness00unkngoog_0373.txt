election For the Jesuit who desires to be
appointed to one mirsion in preference to another, ι
may not use his influence, either directly or
indirectly,. with ‘the society resident about· the·
General and Count at Rome, to procura for him
anemination to the work3 but he* must abide by
his superior's representation of his talenta to the
Pope3 and, according as the latter shall decree,
so he must move.² If the Pope should decline
to make a specific nomination, only requiring
that missionaries may be sent to divers places,
the choico of the appointment then devolvas upon
the General,⁸ and he selecta thern according to-
his own jndgment. They also receive from* him
a description of the nature and purpose of their
several missione, with written instructions for
their guidance.⁴ They must be made to com·
prehend the will and intention of the Pope,
if not in writing, at least by verbal communi-
cation3 and in · failure of any limitation being
assigned to the period of their absence, it is
usually understood to extend to about three
months}⁵ But this must depend upon the suc·
cess of their work, of which they are required
to transmit frequent written communicatione.⁶
