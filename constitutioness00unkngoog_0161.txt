andos whom it may appear, in the course 01 time, either that
that this is not their calling, or that it is not to the common
interest 01 the Society that they continue in it. Butae we
ought not to be too easy in granting admission3 so, still less
should we be too free in dismissing3 but proceed with all con·

weigh before the Lord the causes which may justify the dis-

missal of any one; but generally speaking, there seem to he
four kinds 01 them. ” ’

2 First; 11 it should appear in the Lord to be contrary to His
honour and glory, that an individual shordd continue in this
Socicty, who seems to be incorrigible in any depraved affections
or vices offensive to the divine Majesty ; which should be the
less tolerated, the more serious and culpable they are: and that
