CHAP. I.

l HA'I' they who have been admitted to be Profeseed or Co-
adjutors may devote themselves with more abundant profit
according to our Institute to the service of God, and the suc·
conr of their neighbours, they should observe certain things in
themselves: the chief of which, although comprehended in
those Vows offered up to God and our Creator according to the
Apostolical Letters, shall nevertheless be set forth, in this sixth
part, in order that they may be more distinctly declared and
recommended. And since what pertains to the Vow of Chastity
requires no explanation, it being clear how perfectly it should
be observed, namely by striving to imitate the Angelic holiness
inthe purity both of our mind and body: This being stated,
Holy Obedience shall be spoken of, in which virtue all must
studiously endeavour to make large progress, not only in things
obligatory, but in others, even where there should appear the
aliydteat indication of tte Superior's plectura, without unp capreos
command. God our Creator and Lord should be set before our ¹
eyes, for whose sake Obedience is paid to men: and care must
be taken to proceed in the calm spirit of love, and not in the
troubled spirit of fear, so that we may all strive with stedfast
purpose to neglect no point of perfection, to which by the divine
grace we can attmn, in the absolute observance of all the Con-
stitutione, and the firlfilment of the peculiar object of our Insti-
tute: and may most unremittingly exert every effort in displaying
this virtue of Obedience, first to the Pope, then to the Superiors
ot the Society; so that in all things whereto Obedience pro-
ceeding from love can extend itself, we may be most prompt to
attend to his voice, just oe if it prooeeded from carisa our Lord
