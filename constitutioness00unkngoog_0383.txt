It is not from obscure descriptions that au
opinion of the doctrine of the Jesuits can be

formed, but from their books which (by the
blessing of God) are already very numerous.—
(Vol. xl. Pras.)

Itis from the books of our theologicus that
the reader will easily judge whether our doctrine
is conformed to the doctrine of Jesus Christ.-
(Ibid. Refert. chop. i. E.)

There are many theological works written by
the doctors of the society. We profess the same
doctrine in a vast number of places, both privately,
and publicly in the schools. If at any time
the milder' opinion be preferred, it is with such
excellent reason and authority, that it may be
safely followed, as wellin theory as in practice.-

(Apol. Lib. 1. pr957.)
