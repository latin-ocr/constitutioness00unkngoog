THE CONSTITUTIONS.

vows, 11 they bave taken them, so that all scruples may be
removed.

11 they are 01 1101 description, that it would appear to be
agreeable to God not thus to give them up, more especiallyif
they appear to have gone away under any violent temptation, or
deceived by others, some pains may be taken to bring them
back3 and it will be lawful to use the privileges to this effect
granted by the Apostolical Cbair, so far as the Superior shall
see fit in the Lord. And when any one shall be so brought
back, he shall 10 committed to the prudence 01 110 aforesaid
Superior, who shall see whether any punishment be necessary, or
determine whether it may not be altogether better to proceed in
the spirit 01 lenity: in all which, the interest and edification,
both of him who is brought back, and likewise 01 all the
inmates must be considered. ’
Butif any one of his own accord return to the College or
House which he had 1011 without permission, and he is thought
useful in other respects to the service 01 God; it must be con-
sidered whether he bring with him a true purpose 01 persevering‚
and be ready to make ariy satisfaction and probation: if other- ἱ
wise, and he shows no signs 01 true penitence, he will not be
worthy 01 re-admission.

If any one who hasbeen justly dismissed return to the House
whence he was discharged, prepared for any punishment: if the
same reasons yet remain, for which he was dismissed; it is
clear that he should 001 10 re-admitted. If they do not
remain, and 10 who dismissed him should judge it to be agree-
able to God, that he be again received into the same or any
other House; let him inform the General, or Provincial‚ and do
what is commanded by him.

8 Whether 10 who returns went 01 110 own accord, or was dis-

missed; if he be re-admitted, he ought to' be again examinet,
and a general confession should be made, beginning from that
which he last made in the House down to his return; and he
shall bo put to other probatione and trials, as shall seem good in
the Lord to the Superior, with a view both to the general and
individual edification.
