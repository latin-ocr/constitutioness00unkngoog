seemcd to concur most favourably for the advancement of the-
desigu; for at the same precise period of time, (viz. in August,
1814), the Pope, with a memorable coincidence, issued his Bull for
the restoration of the order of Jesuits3 and, so far as the validity
ef the vows is concerned,‘they were from that moment re·established
throughout the world. There was now, therefore, no longer any
question as to the regularity and suffieiency of a profession made
in this country; and great fucility was thus afforded for the aggre-
gatieu of members. Mr. Kenny was joined at Clongowes by
others of his order, who undertook with him the task of education;
and the affiliation of the younger establishment with the parent
institutiones Stenyhurst, was thus rendered complete. The two
societies have since maintained constant intercourse and mutual
good understanding; and, with force more effective because united,
have proceeded in the design to catholieize the British empire. ., Α
striking circumstance in illustration of the rapid revival of the
influenee of Romanism may be mentioued upon the authority of
Mr. Kenny, who states upon oath, that there were but two mem-
bers of the Jesuit order besides himself in the whole of Ireland,
when he was appointed Viee-President of Maynooth. When'he,
after a short interval, removed to Clongowes, the number of priests,
and of those who might become priests, had increased to nearly
twenty. And from a return ordered by the House ef Commons to
be printed, l5th of June, 1830, the number of persons in Ireland
bound by the Jesuit vows appears to have been 58 ; in England at
the same time, 117. All these, with any augmentation which may
have taken place during the ensuing five years, have grown up as
suckers from that, in appearance exanimate, root which was planted
at Stenyhurst not forty years before.

This design for reviving the Roman Catholie Faith in England
hasbeen thought deserving of more thau domestic encomagement.
It has attracted the attention of foreign states, and has its branches
extended especially to Rome. “The English Catholic Library '’ is
established with the avowed purpose of obtaining proselytes, hy
lending gratuitously books treating of religious controversy and
piety “especially to their Protestant countrymen” when under the
influence of admiration of the ceremonias of the Chureh in “that
seat of Catholicity.’' “Many proofs‚'' it is boasted, have lately
been given “of tle happy effect of those books of instruction?
