Tyrannicidiam, rea scitam catholicorum de Tyranni ister·
accione. Monachii, 1611. (Ε11.Ι Mus. Brit.)

The theologiam generally enquire, whether it
is lawful for a private person to kill a, tyrant.
Lest we involve ourselves in obscurity, we will
distinguish two kinds of tyrants. , There are some
who, invade foreign kingdoms with hostile forces,
who ravage and destroy with the fire and the

sword, against all equity and justice, who plunder
¹ peaceful citizens, and violate all laws, both human
and divine. According to the opinion of many
and most excellent theologiam, these (tyrants)
may certainly be put to death by any one who
has thc courage and inclinatior to kill them.

Tyrants of the other kind, who obtain their
kingdom or empire either by succession 01 elec-
tion, or by any· other right, who are legitimate
rulers, and are accounted to be so, may never be
killed by any man, whether citizen or foreigner.
