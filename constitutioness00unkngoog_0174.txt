suffer detriment; so any bodily exercise‚ which aids either, is
generally necessary for all, those not excepted who ought to be
occupied in mental pursuits, which should be interrupted by
extemnl employments, and not continued nor taken up without
some measure of discretion.

5 The castigation of the body should neither be immoderate nor
indiscreet in vigils, fastings, and other external penances and
labours, which usually do barm, and hinder better things. Itis
expedient therefore that whatever is done in this way be disclosed
by each one to his Confessus, who should refer it to the Superior
if he thinks that moderation is exceeded, or even doubts of
the excess. All these things, however, are done, that we may
proceed more clearly, and that greater glory be given to God
our Lord, both in our souls and bodies.

6 Let there be some one in every House to preside over everything
that relates to the good health of the body, and as well for
maintaining it in the healthy as in those more especially who from
age and other causes are more wealdy, as in restoring it to the
sich, to which person all ought immediately to refer, if they
feel themselves unwell; that the convenient remedy be provided,
as charity requires.

7111 whatever relatas to the protection of temporal property,
beyond that duty which reason and charity impose upon all, it
will be proper that some one be delegated to the office, to watch
over it, as though it belonged to our Lord J esus Christ.

Ilor all other duties, and those especially which are performed
more decently at home than abroad, care must be taken that an
adequate number of officials be appointed; and let the Coad·

jutors in external things learn these duties if they are not al-
rudy acquainted with them, always directing everything to the
greater glory of God our Creator and Lord.
