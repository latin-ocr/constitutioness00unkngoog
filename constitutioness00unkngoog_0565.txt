opposed to the ecclesiastical immunity, and
therefore an injury rather than a benefit is brought v
upon the church (rhod. c.- 13. o. 1.) ψ
The. clergydo not incur the penalty awarded
by the civil laws, neither can thoy bc punichad by
the civil magistrate ; but when the complaint is
brought before their own ecclesiastical judge, the
clergy who offend against ,the civil law should be
punished hy him with descrved punishment, either
with the same penalty which has been awarded by
the civil law to lay-men, or with another and a
milder judgment, as Rodriguez, Vasquez, and
Suarez have well maintained-(Ibid. w. 4.)
Corollary. The civil laws which invalidate a
contractor will, or which render persons incapable
of making a contract or a will, in punishment of
some crime committed by themselves or their
ancestors, do not extend to the clergy, as Navarre
and Suarez remark after the common opinion.
The reason is evident. For such a law is· penal,
and comprises a co-active force3 which ‘cannot
extend to ecclesiastical persona-(Idid. o. 5.)
After 'what has been said,- 'it will be easy to
answer the following question-whether the
obligation of the· clergy to obser've· the civil lews,
which arethe common laws of citizens, and* are
not opposed to the sacred canons and to the
ecclesiastical · governmcnt, proceeds · directly, or
only indirectly, from the civil legislative power?
