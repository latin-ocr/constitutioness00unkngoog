Apologeticus Doctrinae Moralis Societatis Jeau. Lugduni,
1670. (Coloniae, 1672. Ed. Coll. Sion.)

' The adversaries object, that they are taught

by the 'casuists that although money be'promised
for presentatiou to a benefice, yet there is no
simony if the intention of paying it be wanting.
And it is so: the casuists and lawyers maintain
in common, that the spirit of a contract of sale
is not comprised in the words only; ¹andw unless
the will to be bound be also present, that it is
not to be deemed econtract. Since, therefore,
simony is a true oontract of sale, if the intention
os paymeut be wanting, there is no simony. l
aeknowledge, indeed, that a‘ fraud of this kind
deserves punishment.. . This doctrine is main·
tained by almost all the doctors, Lessius, Sotus,
Tolet, Valentia, Suarez, Laymann, Filliucius,
Castro Palao. In my opinion there is in this
no, difficulty-(Anonymua advena Anonymam,

aee· e· a.)

aetus venerei habiti cum sorore. Dixi, non autent ex grati·
tudine, quia tunc nec sacrilegium ullum esset, nec simonia,
aad tantum irreverentia 'quaedam ad summum, re sacri et Deo
dicad remunerando actum turpem et prophanum.'’- Tam. 11.
