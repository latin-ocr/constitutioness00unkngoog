and certainly, when it is considered what crowds are attracted to
Rome 01 Protestants ill-gronnded in the principles of their own
saith, and most favourably situated for receiving the desired
impression, as well as how extended may be their influence in
mtdtiplying the same impression on their return home, this source
01 conversione is not to be thought lightly 01. An Institution 01
more direct influence is ‘¹ the English College ” at Rome, which is
carehdly cherished and mainly relied on, as an effective instrument
for advancing the cause 01 the Romish Church in this country. A
very remarkable proof 01 the deep policy by which it has recently
been thought worth while to attach the students 01 this institution
by redoubled ties to the service for which they are destined, was
afforded in October, 1827; when, for the first time during several
oenturies, the Pope himself visited their summer retreat about
fourteen miles from Rome. A very striking account is extant,
written by a former student 01 Stonyhurst‚ but then a member of
the English college, who was present on the occasion. A most
animated picture is drawn of the extreme affability and condescen-
sion of His Holiness, allowing them to kiss his foot and his haud,
blessiug their beads, dining at their table, conferring upon them as
they knelt before him the very significant appellation 01 “tte hope
astte Charch,” and after his ‚departure sending them as a present
a beautiful young 0011, omamented with fiowers, and moreover
issuing directions to his masters of ceremonies thatin the pro·
0000100 01 Corpus Christi the students 01 the English Collega
should carry the Baldacchino, or hangings, which are borne over
the Pope as he carries the Holy sacrament. Such attentione are
not lavished without an object; and when the period chosen for
this manifestation is considered in connexion with other well-
lrnown circumstances, but slender doubts can remain as to whatis
“ the 110ρο01 the Church,'' or how it is expected 10 110 realized.
These, among many other indications fannish the ground upon
which it is assumed that a design is now in pmgress of execution,
for re·establishing in England the Roman Catholic Religion. The
chief agency is evidently entrusted to the J esuits3 upon which part
01 the subject an observation must be offered, which highly con·

anxious for the general welfare 01 the community. The restora-
tion of that order by Pius VII. has given compactness and
momentum to elements which before that were scattered and
