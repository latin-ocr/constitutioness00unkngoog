01 the Lord: that is, whether the Holy spirit Who gaides them,
promises to them so much grace, that they may hope with His
assistance to sustain the burden of this vocation: and when, by the
inspiration of God, they have enrolled their name in this warfare of
J ESUS Christ, their loios should be girded night and day, and they

should bc ready for the discharge 01 00 great a debt. And that
there may be no secking or refusing among ourselves 01 missions

or provinces 01Ι any kind, let each profess that he will never directly
or indirectly sohcit any thing 01 the Roman Pontiff touching such
missions: but refer all this care to God, and the Pontiff as his
Vicar‚ and to the General 01 the Society. The Genera] also shall
profess, like the rest, that he will 1101 solicit 01 the said Pontiff ’

’ touching his own mission into any part, except with the con·

currence of the Society. All shall vow that they will be obedient
to the Head 01 the Society in all things which tend towards the
observation 01 this our Rule. And he shall ordain whatever
he shall dcem expedient to the attainment 01 the object proposed 10
him by God and by the Society. And in his own elevation, he
shall always be mindful of the benignity‚ and gentleness, and 1010
01 Christ, and of the example 01 Ρο101 and Paul: and both he and
his counsel shall diligently regard this rule; and they shall bave

ignorant people in the Christian doctrine of the ten commandments,
and other the bke rudiments, as shall seem expedient to them
according to the circumstances of persons, places, and times. For
it is most necessary that the General and bis 00110011 diligently
watoh over the management 01 this business3 seeing that the
edifica 01 faith cannot be raised in 0111 neighbours without a
foundation, and there may be danger among ourselves, 1001, as each
shall be more learned he may endeavour to evade this duty, as at
first sight perhaps less engaging: whilst in fact none is more
productive, either 01 edification to our neighbour, or 01 the prac-
tico of the duties 01 charity and humility 1ο 0111001100. Inferiore
1110100101 shall be always bound to obey the General in all things
pertaining to the Instituta 01 the Society, as well 101 the great
advantages 01 order, as 101 the never-to·be·sufficiently lauded
diligent exercise of humility; and shall recognize Christ, as tloaqlr
present in kim, and as far as is beooming, worship him. And sinae
we have experienced that a life most remote from every contagion
