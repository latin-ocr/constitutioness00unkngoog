THE CONSTITUTIONS OF

reverence) leaving every other thing, not staying to finish a
letter even which the pen is tracing, in our eagerness for instant
compliance: directing all our energies to this object and inten-
tion in the Lord; so that Holy Obedience may be perfect in us
in every point, in execution, in will, in intellect; doing whatever
is enjoined us with all celerity, with spiritual joy and per-
