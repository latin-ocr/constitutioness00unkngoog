Jcsuite, are taken from an edition printed at Rome in 1583. There
is a volume of the CONSTITUTIONES, in small 8vo, in'the

Britiah Mueeum, Romae, 1570.
The edition of Progne, in 2 vols. fol. 1757, is that which was
produced on the trial of La Valette‚ wherein the CONSTITUTI-

ONES occupies 91 pages: “ and although it ie clear to' me‚” says
Mr. Penrose* “that numerous additions have incontestably been
made to the original Constitutione, some, perhaps, such aa partially
to supersede them, yet no alteration ln tle letter oftle statute has

' talen place: and whatever infidelities may have been committed in

other metanoea, there is no reason to apprchend that the textos
the CONSTITUTIONES SOOIETATIS JESU, ROMAE‚ 1570,
han at any time been violated. This also, I believe, wasa re-
impression from a preceding edition in 1550.'' (1558.)

1t was in 1558, that the volume of CONSTITUTIONES,
translated from the Spanish of Loyola by Father John poraneus„
was originally committed to the prees by the College of the Society
in Rome: a copy of this edition has fallen into the Editor'a hands3

it ia in small 8vo, and so exceedingly rare, that he has no where

seen it mentioned except in the Synopsis ο1 Damianus, a work of

almost equal scarcity‚ and in the foregoing paragraph where it

*l have collated several pagea, and the most essential passages, of the
edition printed at Rome in 1570, and that oi Antwerp iu 1702, which have
both oi them the sanction of the Society. So far as l have compared them,
they are preciaely similar. The chapters and sections are apparently the same
in each.
