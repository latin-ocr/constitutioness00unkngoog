too in cases where, being concealed, they give no oflenee to
others.

3 Secondly; if it should be considered in the Lord, that to
retain any person would be prejudicial to the interest of the
Society, which as it is a matter of universal concern, should
doubtless be preferred to the private advantage of any one who
is sineerely secking the service of God. Such should be the
case, if in the course of probation any impediments or notable
defects concealed in the examination should he discovered; or
ifupon trial it should be found that he would be very useless,
and that he would rather impede than aid the Society through
his obvious inaptitude to its several duties; and still more if
he should be injurious to it by the evil example of his life,
especially if he be unqaict and offensive to others, either in his
words or actious. To tolerate this would not be charity, but
the very contrary, in him who is bound to maintain the peace
and good estate of the Society entrusted to him.

ll'hirdly3 if it should appear that it would be contrary to the
interest of the Society and of the person also about to be
dismissed; which as relating to the body may happen, if during
Probation, disease or debility he perceived in any one, by which
itis probable he could not advance in his studies according to
ourlnstitute and method of proceeding in furtherance of God’s ¹
service: as concerning the mind; when the probationer cannot
settle himself to alife of Obedicnce, to be regulated according
to the Society’s manner of proceeding3 if he cannot, or will not,
abjectas oren opinions aad jadyment; or for other impedimenta,
whether natiual or habitual.

5 Fourthly ; if it should appear prejudicial to others who are not
οἷ the Society3 asif the bond of matrimony should be dis-
covered, or of legal servitude, or debt of great amount, wherein
upon his first examination he had concealed the truth. Any
one of these four reasons appears sufficient for judging it more
agreeable to God, that he in whom it is found should be
honourably dismissed, than an imprudcnt eharity be exercised in

retaining him.
