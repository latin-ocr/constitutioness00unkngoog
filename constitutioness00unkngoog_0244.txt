THE ΤΕΝΤΗ ΡΑΗΤς

ns tie manner ia ulrici theudule body of tlte Society may be
moutuiued oud increased iu its qood estote. Ι

l SINCE the Society, ulrich uus uot instituted by human meana

can neither he maintained nor increased by them, but by the
Grace of Almighty God and our Lord Jesus Christ; in Him
alone ought our hopes to be fixed, that He will preserve and
promote this work which He has vouchsafed to commence to
His own service and praise,·and the succour of souls.
And in this hope, the first and most congruous means will be
those of prayers and sacrifices, which with this holy intention
ought to be offered, and settled in a fixed successim, through
the several weeks, months and years· in all those places where
the Society resides.

2 For the preservation and increase not only of the body of the
Society, thetis, of things extemal‚ but of the spirit also, and
for fnlfilling the object which it proposes to itself, the succour
of sauls, those means of attaining its ultimate and supernatural
end are the more efficacious which unite the instrument with
God‚ and dispose it to be well directed, by the divine hand,
than those which connect it with mankind. Of this sort are
probity and virtue, and above all charity, and a pure intention
of serving God, and a familiarity with God in spiritual exercises
ol devotion, anda sincere zeal for scula to the glory of Him
