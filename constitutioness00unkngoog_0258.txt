established. He determined, also, that whoever was disposed to
found any new religious house, should submit it to some of the
rules or institutions already approved. From hence it results that
no one has a right to found any new order, without the special
permission of the Roman pontiff, and that with very good reason;
the rather, as the end of the new institutions being the attairrment
of agreater degree of perfection, it is proper that the Apostolic
See should previously and caresully examine the rules of conduct
proposed to be laid down, lest great inconveniencies, and even
standols, should be introduced into the church of God, under the
