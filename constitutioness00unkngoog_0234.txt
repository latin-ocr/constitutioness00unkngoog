chose and sale of all temporal goods whatsoever as well of the
Honses as the Colleges of the Society, and ol raising and re-
deeming any revenues on the freebolds of the Colleges for their
use and benefit, on condition that it may be lawful to aequit
himself of the obligation on restoring the money which shall
have been received. But the General shall not alienate nor
altogether dissolve the Colleges or Houses of the Society once
raised, without a general assembly.

6 Of such things as are left to the Society to dispose of atita
pleasure, whether they be real property, as a house or estate
not specifically applied or annexed to any particular college by
the donor 3 or whether they be goods, as money, corn, or other
moveables, the Genera] may dispose of them by selling, or re-
taining, or applying to this or that place, whatever he shall think
expedient to the greater glory of God.

7 'lhe Provincials, or local Superiora, Rectors and commissioners
shall have so much of this power, as the General shall impart
to them. But the officers of Colleges shall not be corporately
assembled for acts of this nature.

8 As it belongs to the General to see that the Constitutione of
the Society be every where observed; so shall it belong to him
to grant dispewatr'oa in all cases wlwe dispereation is necessary ;
which duty he will execute with that prudence which tlte Liylst
ermol shall communicate, keeping in view the object of these
Constitutione, which is no other than the greater service of
God, and the good oi those who follow this manner of life.
And this is said as much of the trials of those who are under

probation, as of other things in which it shall be judged that
such was the intention of the framers of the Constitutions to
the glory of God and our Imrd.

9 'l'he General shall have all power in missions, in nowise however
opposing those which originate from the Apostolic See, as is set
forth in the Seventh Part. He may send all that are subject to
him, whether Profeased or not, (whom he may resolve to send)
to any parts of the world, for any period, definite or indefinite,
as he shall determine, to do any action of those wbich the
Society is wont to exercise for the succour of souls. He may
recall missionaries, and in short, proceed ia all things, as he shall
think will be to the greater glory of God.

He shall arrange the duties of Preachers, Lecturers and Con-
