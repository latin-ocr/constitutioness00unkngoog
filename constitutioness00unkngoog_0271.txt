from the smallness thereos, or because they know not where to fix
themselves, or on account of age, infirmities, or other grave and

they shall be permitted to dwell therein, provided always that they

entirely subject to tie ordinary of the diocese; that they make ao
acquisitione whatever, according to the decree of the Council of
