Of admission to Probation.

OF HIM wito HAS THE POWER OF ADMISSION.

l Ο whom the power of admittiug to probation is to belong,
and how far its limits are to extend, may be left to the
judgment of the General; who, in communicating it, will con-
sider what is most conducive to the service of God aud our
Lord. “

2 When a person apparently fit to adopt our Instituta shall apply ,
to one who has not this power of admissiou‚ he shall send him
to the party who has, or write to him, signifying what manner
of person he is who desires to be admitted, and with what gifts
of God he is endowed; andis the other have authority to direct
in his absence, let him do that which is commanded him in the

¹ Lord.

3 Because it greatly concems God's service that a fit selection be
made of those who are admitted, and that diligence be used to
ascertain the particulars respecting their person and calling:
whoso has this power of admissiou‚ if he cannot himself make ,
the iuquiry, let him employ from among those who are con-
stautly about his person some oue whose assistance he may use
to become acquainted with the probationem, to live with them,
and examine them; some oue endowed with prudence‚ and not

uuskilled in the marmer which should be observed in dealing
with so many various kinds and conditious of persons; so that
this business may be managed with greater intelligence‚ aud

more satisfaction to either party for the glory of God.
