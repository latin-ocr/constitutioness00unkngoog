Is a judge bound to restore the bride which Ire
llas received for pronouncr'og jadgmeot?

Auem-If he has received it for a just sentence
he is bound to restore it, because it was otherwise

uo benefit for his money.

lf the judge has received it for an unjust sen·

restitution, as Beonan, Sanchez, dcc. teach, be-

unjust sentence. But this action is useful to the
pleader‚ and the'unjust judge exposes himself to
great danger by it, especially in his reputation,
if he should be convicted of injustice. Now the
reponare to auch danger in the service of another
