Doctors or rectors are not compelled to iu·
culcate the opinions which seem to them to be
the more prohable. For those opinions are
often the less generally received aud approved,
and might occasion scandal: and an 'irksome ,task
would be imposed u'pon 'the masters, if they
were compelled ιιι read those things which' should
appear to them the more probable. ..For, in
consequence of such compulsion, they would have
to examine thoroughly every argument on either
side of a question3 and frequently,' the opinion
which yesterday seemed to them to be the more
probable, will to-day appear the less probable3
