Collega ought to offer the same sacrifice for them for ever. On
that day, moreover, in every year, on which possession of each
Collega was given to the Society, let it be solemnized with a
Mass for the Founder and benefactors; aud whatever Priests
are present in the College at that time, let them all celebrate
their sacrifices there.

3 On that day let a wax candle be offered to the Founder‚ orto
one nearest allied to him in family, orto him whom the Founder
himself appoints, in which candle there shall be the arms of the .
Founder, or the emblema of devotion. Iu that shall the Society
testify the gratitude which it owes to its Founder in the Lord.

4 As soon as the Society shall come into possession of any Col-
lege, let the General see that it be communicated to the whole ¹
Society, that every Pn'est may thrice say Mass for the living
Founder of the College and its benefactors; that the Lord may
guide them with His benignity in all things, and enrich them
ever with His gilts. Again‚ when they shall have departed this
life, the General will take care, as soon as he hears of it, that
throughout the Society every Priest say three Masses for their
souls. And as often as it is said, Masses are to be solemnized

hythe Priests; all the rest who live in Colleges, and are not
Priests, ought to pray to the same purpose3 since they are all

bound in the Lord to the same gratitude.

5'l'he Founders moreover, and the benefactors of Colleges are
made partalers of all tle qood worls which are done, by tlte
yrace of God, not only iu the Colleges, but in the whole
Society. -

filu general, however, the Society should understand that it is

. peculiarly bound in Charity‚ as well to Founders‚ as to their

connexione, as long as they live, and after their deceasa to do
them every service which can be rendered by us according to
our humble profession to the glory of God.
