another and with their head is the Love of God and our Lord
lesus Christ, with whose divine and supreme goodness, if the
Superior and inferiora are closely united, they will easily be
united among themselves ; and this will be affected by that
same love which coming down from God extends to all our
neighbours, and in an· especial manner to the body of the So·
ciety. Charity, therefore, and to sum up all, probity and every
virtue, by which we may walk according to the Spirit of God,
will assist each party to union, and subdue every idea of
temporal property, in which sels-love, the fiercest foe of union
and the general good, habitually offenda. Unanimity also in
more internal concerns will contribute much to this3 as learning,
opinions, aspiratione, as far as possible: in externals also; as
habita, the ceremonias of the Mass, and other things, so far as
the differeuce of persona, places, dac. shall permit.

and immediate intelligence of one another; and the knowledge
of all that is communicated from various places for edification,
and of all that happens will greatly assist also; the management
of all which shall be in the Superiora, and especially in the
General, and the Provincials; such arrangements being made,
‚that in every place whatever tends to mutual consolation and
edification in the Lord may be lmown from the others.

l 'l'o come to the personal union which takes place in the Congre-
gations of the Society3 we must consider as well iu what cases,
as what persons ought to be called together, and by whose au·
thority; where, when, and how this should take place, and what
business should be transacted in the Congregations. And in
the first place, that it may be set forth in what cases a general
Congregation and Assembly shall be held; this is especially laid
down: that it seems by no means expedient in the Lord at
present, that they occur at certain seasons or frequently. For
the General, aided by the intercourse which he maintains with
the whole Society, and the assistance of those who live with him,

shall prevent, as far aa possible, so much labour and intenuption
