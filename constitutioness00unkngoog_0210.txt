Superior: whether it be to their own improvement and edifica-

tion, or of others, among whom they live.

4 Since those occupations which arc undertaken-for tlie'succour of
souls are of great moment, and peculiar to our institute, and
very frequent3 and since moreover our dwelling is so uncertain
in one place or another ; our members shall not serve the Choir
at cononioal hours, or the saying of Masses or other offices: as
there will be abundant opportunity for them who are led by
devotion to hear them to satisfy themselves But that should
be attended to by us which is more agreeable to our calling to
the glory of God. ι

asinae likewise the members of this Society should always be
prepared to go to any quarter of the globe, to which they shall
be sent by the Pope, or their Superiors 3 they should not under-
take the care of souls, nor of Religious, or any other women
whatsoever, so as commonly t0 hear their Confessiona or direct
them; although there is no objection to their receiving the Con-
fessions of a Monastery once and for special reasons.

6 Itis by no means right for them to be bound to say perpetual
Masses in their Churches, or to any similar duty, which the
liberty necessary to our method of proceeding in the Lord does
not allow of.

l 'lhat the Society may be at greater leisure for spiritual concems
according to its Institute; let them obstoin, as far as possible,
from recolor affairs, such as the making of wills, executorships,
or the management of civil business, or duties of that kind: nor
undertake them, nor allow themselves to be occupied with them
under any urgenoy of entreaty. And if any affairs of the
Colleges require attention, let them have their own prootors, to
manage them, and uphold their rights. But if they concern
the Houses of the Society‚ or its whole body; that the Society
may better maintain its tradquillity, the same prootor may
defend its rights, or some one of the Coadjutors, or some one
even without the Society, or some Family, which shall take
upon itself the patronage of the House, to the greater glory oi
God.

8 For the same reason, and that occasions of disturbance contrary
to our profession may be avoided, and peace and good-will be
better maintained with all, to the greater glory of God, no one of
the Professed, or Coadjutors, or even Scholars of the Society
