THE CONSTITUTIONS or

subsist on 01101, they also shall live in the same way. If they
are Rectors' 01 Colleges, or lecturers, or useful 10 any other
necessary or advantageous employments, they shall live as the
others do, out 01 the college-revennae, so long 11 these shall

’ require their service. When they shall 00110 tobeuseful to the

Colleges, let them no longer live in them; and they shall dwell
in the Houses 01 the Society, as 11 said of the Professed.

5 Not only shall the Houses and Churches 01 the Society have no

revenues, but not even any possessions whether peculiar or com-
mon, except what is needful, or exceedingly convenient to them
for habitation or use; 01 which kind it might be considered

a salubrious air, and other advantages, 101 the 010 01 the con-
valescent, or 01 those who withdraw from the intercourse 01 the
world to be at leisure for spiritual concerns; and even 11100 11
shall not be let out to others, nor produce anything which may
be looked upon as revenue.

Although it is praiseworthy to incite men 10 good 101 holy
works‚ and especially to such as shall endure for ever; yet 101
greater edification no member 01 001 Society ought nor is
allowed to stimulate any 000 10 leave perpetual alms to the
Houses or Churches of this Society: and if any persons leave
such spontaneously‚ 00 civil right is acquired to secure them, so
that he who refuses 10 pay them cau be sued for them. But
when the Love 01 God moves them to do so, alea they may
bestola theat.

All who are under Obedience to the Society should remember
that they ought to give gratuitously what they have gratuitously
received, neither demanding, nor receiving pay, 0111101, by
which Messes, or Confessions, or Sermone, or Lessons, or Visi-
tations, or any other duty 01 all those which the Society can
100101 according to our institute, may appear 10 be remunerated;

that so it may proceed with greater liberty and 0111011100 01001
neighbours in God’s service.

8 To avoid all appearance 01 001010010011, especially in offices of
piety which the Society discharges for the succour of sauls, let
there be no box in the church, into which alms are generally put
by those who go thither to Sermons, Mass, or confession, and
other spiritual concerns.

For the same reason let no trifies be presented to the grem
