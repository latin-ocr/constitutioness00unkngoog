illustrious monarcha, and having only in view the glory of God and
the salvation of sauls, we by our Brief, beginning Per aliae, and
dated the aoth July, 1804, extended to the kingdom of the Two
Sicilies the same concessious which we had made for the Russian
empne.

The Catholie world demands with unanimous voice the re-establish-
ment of the Company of Jesus. We daily receive to this effect
the most pressing petitione from our venerable brethren‚ the Arch-
b'nhops and Bishops, and the most distinguished persons, especially
since the abundant fruits which this company has produced in the
above countries have been generally known. The dispersion even
of the stones of the sanctuary in those recent calamities (which it
isbetter now to deplere than to repeat); the annihilation of the

oi the holy Roman Cburch, we have deereed with full knowledge,
in virtue of the plenitude of apostolic power, and with perpetual
validitp, that all the concessione and powers granted by us solely to
the Russian empire and the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, shall
henceforth extend to all our eeclesiastical States, aud also ta all
aller States. We therefore concede and grant to our well-beloved
son, Taddeo Barzozowski, at this time General of the Company of
lesus, and to the other members of that company lawfully delegated
by him, all suitable and necessary powers in order that the said
Sutes may freely and lawfully receive all those who shall wish to
be admitted into the regular Order of the Company of J esus, who,
