erimberto Angliae Reginae, lraeresim Celsinianum propug-

nantis, saevissimam in Catholicos rui Regni Edictum, quodie Ι

alios quoque Reipublicae Christiane Principes contumelias
continet indignissimas. Per Andraeam Philopatrom.³⁴ Lug-
duni, 1593. (Augustae, 1592. Ed. Bibl. Acad. Cant.)

Hence the whole school of theologians and

ecclesiastical lawyers maintain (and it is a thing
both certain and matter of saith), that every
Christian prince, if he has manifestly departed
from the Catholic religion and has wished to turn
others from it, is immediately divested of all power

³³ ‘⁴ Tyrannice gubernans juste acquisitum dominium, non
potest spoliari sine publico judicio: lata vero sententio, potest
quisque fleri executor: potestantem deponi dpopalo, etiam qui
juravit ei obedientiam perpetuam, sl monitasaon vult corrigi.”-
