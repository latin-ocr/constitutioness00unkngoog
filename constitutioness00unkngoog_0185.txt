l 11001110 being 11011 001 only to the progress of our own Scholars
in literature, but 10 the progress also of those not of our
Society in literature and morals, whom we have admitted into
our Colleges to be instructed let public Schools be opened,
wherever it may conveniently be done, at least for Polite 110010-
ing. In the more important studies, they may be opened with
reference 10 the circumstances of the places where our Colleges
exist, always keeping before our eyes what shall be most pleasing
to God. ι.

2 ln these Schools let that method be purshedby which the ex-
ternal Scholars may be well instructed 10 011 that 101010010
Christian Learning3 and let care be taken, usfar as possible,
they may attend 110 Sacrameot of Confession 0000 0 01001110-
quently hear the word of God, and in short imbibe, together
with learning, morals becoming Christians. And because, in
particular subjecte, there must needs be much variety, according
10 the difference of places and persons, we shall not here insist
upon 1110111 severally: but this may be declared that rules should
be established in every College which shall embrace all necessary
points. And we may in this place recommend that tle 0011100τί00
which the extemal Scholars require 01011 never 10 1011110111 .·
only 101 11 be administered by somenae 1010 10 notos oar Society.

3·As it 10 peculiar to our profession to receive no temporat renatae-
rction for spiritual services, 10 which according 1ο 0111 Institute
we are engaged for the service of our fellow-creatmes3 it 10 001
expedient 10 receive any endowment 01 0 College, by which the
Society shall be bound 1ο maintain aPreacber, 01 confessor, or
Lecturer 10 Theology. For although a regard to equity and
gratitude should stir us to attend with increased diligence to the
said ministratione which belong to our Institutc; yet in our
Colleges which have been founded with greater liberality and
devotion, no obligations or conditione shall be admitted, which
may derogate from the sincerity of our manner of proceeding,
namely to give freely what we have freely received; still, for the
support of those who labour or study for the common good of
the College, 1101 endowment moy 10 accepted which the charity of
Founders assigns 10 the glory of God.
