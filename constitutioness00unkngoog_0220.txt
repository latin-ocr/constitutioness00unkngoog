various regions of the world, the more diligently should the

means of maintaining that union be secured; since the Society
can neither be preserved, nor govemed, nor, consequently, can
the object be attained at which it aima, to the greater glory of
G0d; unless its members be united among themselves, and with
their Head We will, speak therefore of those things which
relate to the usual persoual union in Congregations or conventa. ‚
Now towards this union of minds, some things on the part of
inferiors, some on the part of Superiora some originating in
both will be conducive.

2 With regard to inferiora, it will be well that no great number of
persons be admitted to Profession; and not every one, but select
men only should be retained among the Coadjutors or Scholars.
lbra great multitude of such as have not quite subdued their
fauts, as they cannot endure subordination, so neither can they
secure union, which is so needful in Christ our Lord, for the
preservatiou of the good estate and method of proceeding of
the Society.

3Aud since a great union of this sort is secured chiefly by the
lundras Obedienee; this must ever be maintained in all its vigour:
And those who are sent forth from the Houses to labour in the
Lord’s harvest, should be well exercised therein, as far as possi-
ble: and in this virtue, such as take the lead in the Society
should outshine the rest in their good example; and always in
harmony with their Superior should persevere promptly, humbly
and devotedly in their obediende to him. And if any one has
failed in giving unquestionable proof of his obedience‚ an asso-
ciate should always be united with him, who has been more
conspicuous therein. For, for the most part, an associate who
is more perfect in Obedieuce will by the divine favour therein
assist him who is less so. And otherwise, although this object
henot aimed at, a Collcague should be appointed to him who
shall be sentin any charge of government, if it should appear to
the Superior, that the duty thus committed to him will be better
performed 3 and the Colleague shall so behave towards him who
is over the rest, and he in turn towards his Colleague, that the
Obedieuce and revercnce of the inferiors for their Superior be
not· impaired: but rather that the one may find the other to
have been given to be a true and faithful assistant aud supporter,
'ds well to himself aa to those committed to his carc.
