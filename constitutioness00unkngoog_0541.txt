Since God alone is the 'Lord of life and death,

the state cannot, upon its own authority, invest ¹

princes with the power 0110310101100 and govern-
ment‚ in which the power 01 01100011ος male-
factors is included3 but God alone cando so.
Yet this last assertion is frivolons3 for,· as yon
affirm 11101 this power is imparted ¹unto kings by
God, Ιἱ will affirm that itis imparted by God,¹
asthcAuthor 01001010, 10 the state ; and that
the state¹ may grant the power nnto kings, as it x
also possessos from its very nature the right 01
deposing atyrant from t'heoovereignty‚ and even,
1111000001 otherwise expel him, 01 putting him
10 death . See also Mariana, Dc 11031οΙ0110- Ι
