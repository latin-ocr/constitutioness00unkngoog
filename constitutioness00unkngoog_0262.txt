We, therefore, having these and other such examples before our
eyes, examples of great weight and high authority3 animated,
besides, with a lively desire of walking with a sese conscience and
yfirm step in the deliberations ot which we shall speak hereafter,

leve omitted no ecre, ao puina, in order to aerim ata tborcuqb know-
ledye uf the eripis, the propress, end tle actual state of tbat reputer
order commonly called “ rae Cumpcuy ofJesus.'’ In the course of
these investigations, we have seen that the holy founder of this
order did institute it for the salvation of souls‚ the conversion of
heretice and infidels, and, in short, for the greater advancement of
piety and religion. And in order to attain more surely and happily
so laudable a design‚ he consecrated himself rigorously to God, by
au absolute vow of evangelical poverty, with which to bind the
society in general, and each individual in particular, except only the
colleges, in which polite literature and other branches of knowledge
were to be taught, and which were allowed to possess property, but
so that no part of their revenues could ever be applied to the use
of the said society in general. It was under these and other holy
restrictione, that the Company of Jesus was approved by the Pope
Paul 111.. our predecessor, ot blessed memory, by his letter sud
plorabo, dated 27 September, 1540, He granted them besides, the
power of forming laws and statutes, to secure the advantages,
stability, and good order of the society on a more solid footing.
And though Paul 111. did at first restrain this company to the num-
ber of sixty; yet, by his letter ot the llth of March, 1543, he gave
the superiore of the said company power to admit as many mem-
bers as they pleased. Atterwards the same pontiti, by his brief,
dated May 15, 1549, favoured the said company with many and
extensive privileges; among others, he willed and ordered that the
iadalt, which he had already accorded to the preceding generals,
should be extended to all such as the generals should think worthy
of it. This induit has hitherto been restrained to the power of
admitting only twenty priests, as spiritual coadjutore, to whom were
tube granted allthe same privileges, and the same authority, as to
the professed companions of the order. Further, he exempted and
withdraw the said order, its companions, persons, and possessione
whatever, from all dominion and jurisdiction of all ordinaries what-
ever, taking them under the immediate protection of himself and
the Holy See.

The munificence and liberality of other pontiffs, our predecessore,
