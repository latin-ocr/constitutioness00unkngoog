Those who, at the conclusion 01 their first probation and proofs
usual in the biennium, 010 admitted to be Scholars, in the
presence 01 00110111 1111110100, though not to any person, shall make
their Vows in this manner.

4 Almighty, Everlasting God, I. N. albeit every way most unwor-
thy in Thy holy sight, yet relying on Thine infinite pity and
0011100001011,011111111110110111))1 the desire 01 serving Thoe, in the
presence 01 the most holy Virgin Many, and before all Thine
heavenly host, vow to Thy divine Majesty, perpetual Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience in the Society 01 10000, 01111 promise
that l will enter the same Society‚ to live in it perpetually ;
understandinq all tbinys according to tie Constitutione of tlte
Society. 01 Thy boundless goodness and mercy through the
blood 01 Jesus Christ Ι humbly pray that Τ11011 wilt deign to
accept this sacrifice in the odour 01 sweetuess, and, 00 Τ11011
hest granted Thine abundant grace 10 desire and offer, so Τ11011
wilt enable me to fulfil the same ; At Rome, or elsewhere,
in such a place, day, mouth and year.

Τ11011 shall they take, as the others, the most holy body 01
Christ, and the rest 01 the ceremony shall proceed as before.

5 When any one shall be adopted into the body 01 the Society in
any degree, he ought not to be 0111110110 10 proceed to another;
but to be perfect in his own, employing himself in the service 01
God, and leaving the care 01 011 other things to his Superior,
who doubtless holds tlte place os Clna'st carr Lord.

6 Those who live 111 0111 Houses after two years should take the
same vows as the Scholars, and bind themselves to Christ our
Lord; and that, although they be 1101 put to studies, and al·
though it be not thought expedient that they be admitted so
early among the Coadjutors or the Professed. But if any one,
urged by his private feelings 01 devotion should wish, before this
period of two years to offer himself 10 God by Vows‚ 110 may
use the same form, and deliven'ng 10 the Superior one copy of
his written Vow, keep another himself, that what 1101100 offered
to God and our Lord may be remembered. And 10 this end,
and likewise to increase devotion, it will conduce, at certain
stated and convenient scasons to renew their Vows. Which is
not to bind themselves by a new obligation, but to call to mind

in the Lord and confirm that by which they are already bound.
