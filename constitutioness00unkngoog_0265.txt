consequence whereof ithae been wisely ordained by our superiora
and ancients, that confining ourselves to cambit for the glory cf
God, we should not concern ourselves with matters foreign to our
profession: but whereas in these times of difficulty aud danger it
has happened, through the fault perhaps of certain individuali,
through ambitiun and intemperate zeal, that our institute has been
ill spoken of in divers places, and before divers sovereigns, whooe
affection aud good will the Fathcr Ignatius, of holy memcry,
thought we should preserve for the good of the service cf God:
and whereas a good reputaticn is indispensably necessary to malie
tle amandos Christ bir'nq sarth sivit& in consequence hereof
cur congregation has resolved that we should abstain from all
appearance of evil, and remedy, as far as in our power, the evils
arisen from false suspicions. To this end, and by the authority of
the present decree of the said congregation, it is severely and
strictly forbidden to all the members of the society, tv intersere i'ii
any mnacr whatever i'n public affairs, even though they be thereto
invited; or to deviate from the institute through inueaty, per-
suasiones any other motive whatever. The congregation recom-
mends to the fathers-coadjutore, that they dc propose and deter-
mine, with all diligence and speed, such further means as they may
think necessary for remedying this abuse.''
