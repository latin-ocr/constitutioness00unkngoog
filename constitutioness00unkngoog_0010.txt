Wnnrnvnn degree of notoriety the Constitutions of the Society
of Jesus might have attained their authoritative promulgatiou did

not occur until 1761, when in the course of the celebrated suit of
the MM. Lionci and Father La Volette,* the Jesuits were “so
inconsiderate as to produce the mysterious volume of their institute.
By the aid of these authentis reeords, the principles of their
governmeut may be deliuested and the sources of thcir power

investigated with a degree of certainty and precision‚ which pre-

vious to that event it was impossible to attuin.’'†

The authors of this extraordinery code, consciens of the just
olamour which would be excited by its publication, obliged all

⁴ “Cette question soumit su parlement une occasion toute naturelle de
demander h voir ces constitutions l'ameuses, qui jamnis n' avaient ete ni exam-
iuees, ni approuvees erec lec formes requises. Ι] examen de ces constitutions,
et ensuite celui de leurs liures, a lourni des moyens juridiqnes plus que
suffisans pour declaret leur institut contraire aue loix du royeumc, ὰ t' obe'iennce
dne nu souverain, ἃ la reret& de se peronne, et ὰ la tranquillite' de ι’ e‘tat.”
