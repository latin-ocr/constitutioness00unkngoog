comparatively inert. Under what circumstances was this effected,
and how is it likely to involve us? The Jesuits within little more
than two centuries (1555 to 1773), had suffered thirty-seven
expulsions from various states. Such of these as took place during
the 18th century had occured in those states of Europe which are
most devoted to the Romish saith: viz. Savoy, 1729; Portugal,
1759; Spain and the two Sicilies, 1767; Parma, 1768; Malta,
1768. Lastly‚ as if to crown the whole by a most signal and
exemplary instance, they were in 1773, suppressed at Rome and in
all Christendom by a Bull of Pope Clement XIV. This prelate
was cautious and temperate in disposition, not unaware of the
importance to the Church of the services of this Order, nor of
the scandal which must arise from his suppression of it. He had
within his reach in the archives of the Propaganda, sources of infor-
mation to which the rest of the world had not access. He deliberated
upon these and upon the pleadings of the Society in its own justifi-

deliberately set his hand to the instrument of suppression. Thus
ec cathedra he pronounced the Society to be inherently wicked and
mischievous, dangerous to the peace of the world, and unworthy of
any longer toleration. Severe as this censure may appear, the
Abhe dc Bernis, at that time Ambassador from France to Rome,
declares from his own acquaintance with the facts, that the Sove-
reign Pontiff “would have been more than sufficieutly justified, if
the love of peace had not closed his mouth.'’ Forty years after
this the world behcld with astonishment the issue of a -Bull by the
reigning Pope, reversing the decree of his predecessor, legalizing
the vows of that so often prohibited Society, and placing it in a
condition to exercise, in all the countries of the world, that dis-
cipline which all had united in pronouncing injurious to their

. - welfare. The Bull of Pope Clement amounted to a verdict against

the Jesuits, who had been accused of insatiable avidity for tempora]
possessions, dangerous seditions, massacres hatreds‚ enmities,
prevaricatione which must destroy all social confidence, and trea-
sonable practices such as endangered the safety of all govern-
ments Yet Pope Pius, unaccountably forgctting or purposely
omitting to notice this condemnation‚ restored the Society in a
most unqualified manner. He without any reserve recalled to
existence an Order against which the most papistical states, and
the papacy itself had united in pronouncing sentence ; and their
