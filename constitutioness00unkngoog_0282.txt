as conveniendy prepared for the accommodatiori of 150 scholare.
In addition to the pupils whose circumstances enabled thern to pay
the regulated charges for boarding and tuition, it was generally
understood that a certain number cf the children of poorer parents
were received, for gratuitous education, upon the foundation of the
college; who might be afterwards adopted into the Society and
employed in forwarding its designs, as they should be found to
unite a suitable inchnation for the service, with promising talents
