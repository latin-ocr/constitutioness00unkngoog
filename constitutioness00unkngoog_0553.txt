Hurtado assents to this doctrine.v He adds
moreover that ¹the pope, because heis at the ·
same time a temporal king, may carry on war

against infidels in those cases in which other „

Christian princes might do so upon his authority:
wherefore also he might raise an army and direct
it by his command⁵⁹ . . . Although the ministers
of the gospelought not strictly to defend them· “
selves with force, hy attacking and killing their
adversaries, 'yet it may sometimes be expedient
todo so for the greater advantage of the faith.
For what if a. petty king should oppose the eon-
version of a vast kingdom or empire, hy im-
prisoning and persecuting the preachers who have
been sent for that purpose? They might not only
escape by flight, but they might also overpower
their guarda or they might liberate themselves ’
and continue the work which ‘they had begun‚

provided the sovereign pontiff did not withhold
his permission.-(Ihid. a. 50.)

⁵⁹ “Addit tamen, posse papam, quia est umal ree tempo-
ralis, bellum infidelibus inferre, quando scilicet alii principes
Christiani ex ejus commissione possent: quare posset tunc
exercitum cogere, illumque jure suo mittere.”-Disp. 19.
