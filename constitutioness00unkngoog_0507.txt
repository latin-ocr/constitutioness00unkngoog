Some think that the value cannot be accu-
rately defined, but that it must rest upon the
opinion of a prudent man depending upon the
circumstances of time and place, and on the 'man-
ner in which the theft has been committed, the
injury which has resulted from it, and the quality
of the persons, whether they are princes, rich
men, persons in the middle rank of life, or poor.-
(Torn Ι. Liuv. Qu. 3. c. 2. §1.)

A son is sometimes, and even often, to be
accounted free from deadly sin and from the
necessity of restitution, when he robs his father:
and sometimes he is rechoned to sin grievously.
Α εοιῐ is not accounted to sin mortully, 1. when
he has a probable reason for believing'‚ that if his
father were asked, he would grant him (what he
steals) without reluctance3 for then the owneris
not averse to the matter, but to the manner of
the transaction. 2. If the amount is not thought
considerable in respect to his condition. 3. If
he steals with the intent to give alnis to one who
is in great need; for then his parentis not cccc “
sonably averse to it. ' 4. If he robs his father to

,procure an innocent diversiou suited to his rank
