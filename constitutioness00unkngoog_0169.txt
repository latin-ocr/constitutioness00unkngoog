THE CONSTITUTIONS ΟΡ

open his conscience. Which Conlessor ought not to be at a loss
what cases should be received for the Superior. Those then
shall be reserved which shall seem necessary or highly expedient
to be known by him; in order that he may the better applya

remedy, and preserve those committed to his care from all things

· hurtful.

12 It will be highly useful, that there be in every House a faithful
man, sufficiently skilled in spiritual concerns, to instruct and
teach them how they ought to behave themselves, both inter-

which the Society has in view, the service and praise of God.

15 What measure should be observed in enjoining penances and
corrections, must be left to the prudent charity of the Superior,
and those whom he has deputed ; who in these matters will regard

, the dispositione of persons and the general and individual edifi-
