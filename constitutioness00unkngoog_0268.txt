SUPPRESHON Oll THE SOCIETY OF JESUS. ll9

of Lights his particular assistance under these circumstances ; ex-

horting at the same time the faithful to cozoperate with us by their

prayers aud good works in obtaining this needful succour.

And first of all we proposed to examine upon what grounds
rested the common opinion, that the institute of the clerks of the
company of Jesus had been approved and confirmed in an especial
manner by the Council of Trent. And we found, that in the said
oouncil nothing more was done with regard to the said society,
only to except it from the general decree, which ordained that in
the other regular orders, those who had finished their noviciate,
aud were judged worthy of being admitted to the profession,
should be admitted thereto; and that such as were not found
vorthy, should be sent back from the monastery. The same
ccuncil declared, that it meant not to make any change or innova-
tion in the govemment os the clerks of the company of J esus, that
they might not be hindered from being useful to God and his
church, according to the intent of the pious institute approved by
the Holy See, .

obliges us to conciliate, maintain, and confirm the peace and
tranquillity of the Christian republic, and remove every obstacle
which may tend to trouble it ; having further considered that the

said Company of J esus can no longer produce those abundant fruits
and those great advantages, with a view to which it was instituted,
approved by so many of our predecessore, and endowed with so
many and extensive privileges; th'at on the contrary it was very
difficult, not to say impossible, that tlte Charclr could recover a firm

hereos, and determined by the particular reasons we have here
alleged, and forced by other motives which prudence, aad the good
govemment of the Church have dictated, the knowledge of which
we reserve to ourselves, conforming ourselves to the examples of
our predecessore, and particularly to that of Gregory X. iu the
General Council of Lyons; the rather as, in the present case, we
arc determining upon the fate of a society closacd amcrap the
mendicam orders, both by its institute aad by its privilepes. After a
mattae deliberation, we do, out of our certmn knowledpe, and tlte
